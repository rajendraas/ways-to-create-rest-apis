# REST API implementation with JavaScript

This page includes the REST API implementation with JavaScript. I've used node version v20.10.0 for this implementation.

There are multiple frameworks to implement REST APIs with JavaScript, ex - Express, Nest.js, Loopback etc. Currently, we have Express implementation.

Other framework implementation will be added as the time permits.
