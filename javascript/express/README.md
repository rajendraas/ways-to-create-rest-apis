# REST API implementation with Express framework

This project contains REST API implementation example with Express framework. You'll need basic knowledge of JavaScript before you can start exploring this project.

## Steps to run server locally

Before you start the server, please start the MySQL server.

To run the server locally -
`node src/app.js`

You don't need to run any specific server to run this project, like we need Tomcat server in some Java based REST API implementation.

Access the API through http://localhost:3000/city/pune
