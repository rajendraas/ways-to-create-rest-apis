# REST API implementation with Java

This page includes the REST API implementation with Java. I've used version 17 for this implementation. 

There are multiple frameworks to implement REST APIs with Java, ex - Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Jersey JAX-RS, Quarkus etc. Currently, we have Spring Boot & Spring MVC implementation.

Other framework implementation will be added as the time permits.
