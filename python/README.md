# REST API implementation with Python

This page includes the REST API implementation with Python. I've used Python v3.12.x for this implementation.

There are multiple frameworks to implement REST APIs with Python, ex - FastAPI, Django, Flask etc. Currently, we have FastAPI implementation.

Other framework implementation will be added as the time permits. If you know a framework, and want to contribute to this repo, please feel free to raise a pull request.
