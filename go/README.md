# REST API implementation with GoLang

This page includes the REST API implementation with GoLang. I've used version go1.22.0 for this implementation.

There are multiple frameworks to implement REST APIs with GoLang, ex - Gin, Mux, Echo etc. Currently, we have Gin implementation.

Other framework implementation will be added as the time permits.
